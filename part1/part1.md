1. i, which is prices.length will be logged to the console, as it is declared using global-scoped "var"
2. the calclated discountedPrice wll be logged to the console because var is visible through code blocks.
3. finalPrice will be logged to the console because vars is globally scoped.
4. it will return [50, 100, 150], as it is the array containing each calculated final discounted price from the input array prices.
5. an error will occur because i is only visible in the for loop because it is declared using "let", which is not visible outisde the loop.
6. an error will occur because discountedPrice is only visible in the for loop because it is declared using "let", which is not visible outisde the loop.
7. finalPrice will be logged to the console because it is not declared within the for loop and within the function
8. an error will occur because i is not accessible 
9. an error will occur because i is only visible in the for loop because it is declared using "let", which is not visible outisde the loop.
10. an error will occur because discountedPrice is only visible in the for loop with "const"
11. finalPrice will be logged to the console because it is not declared within the for loop and within the function using "const"
12. an error will occur because the const finalPrice cannot be reassigned
13.
  - A. student.name
  - B. student['Grad Year']
  - C. student.greeting()
  - D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
  - E. student.courseLoad[0]
14.
  - A. '32' as each value is converted to strings and then concatenated 
  - B. 1 as '3' is converted into a number
  - C. 3 as null is converted into the number 0
  - D. '3null' as null is a string and the two are concatenated
  - E. 4 as true is converted into the number 1
  - F. 0 as false and null are both 0
  - G. '3undefined' as undefined is a string and the two are concatenated
  - H. NaN as undefined cannot be converted into a number
15.
  - A. true because string '2' becomes the number 2
  - B. false because they are not the same strings
  - C. true because '2' is converted into the number 2
  - D. false because === checks for equality without type conversion
  - E. false because true is 1 
  - F. true because Boolean(2) is also true
16. the difference between the == and === operators is that === checks the equality without type conversion while == is just a regular equality check.


17. 'How are you?' gets printed because the comparison 2 == true is false as 2 is not equal to 1, so we go to the else if block where the condition is true, thus printing 'How are you?'.
